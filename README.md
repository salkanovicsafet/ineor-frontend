# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

First cd into the project directory, then run the json server (mock backend) by using

### json-server db.json

after that run react by using:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view the frontend in the browser. The mock backend is running on port 3000.

Enjoy!
